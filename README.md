👋 Hello, I'm Nikhil, a passionate full-stack developer and fourth-year B.Tech undergraduate student at IIT Palakkad. 💻 I specialize in web development and have expertise in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and the Django framework.

🌟 With a keen interest in crafting user-friendly interfaces and scalable applications, I've gained practical experience through internships and honed my skills in various domains. As a Full Stack Web Developer Intern at Business Web Solutions (Jan 2023 - Mar 2023), I worked on projects involving responsive web pages and API integration.

🔧 Additionally, during my time at SatCard (May 2023 - July 2023), I contributed to improving the frontend of the admin website, integrated the WhatsApp Business API using Python and Django, and built a dynamic 'Reports' page. This page enables administrators to select date ranges and obtain customized outputs based on real-time data collected from devices deployed in the field, including parameters like temperature and pressure.

💡 Alongside my practical experience, I actively engage in competitive programming on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. This helps me enhance my problem-solving skills and stay up-to-date with the latest algorithms and data structures.

🌐 Constantly seeking growth and learning opportunities, I enjoy staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and exploring innovative solutions.

🤝 I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on open-source projects, and contribute to the tech community. Let's build something amazing together!
