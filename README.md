👋 Hello there! I'm Nikhil, a passionate full-stack developer and fourth-year B.Tech undergraduate student at IIT Palakkad. My expertise lies in web development, where I specialize in crafting seamless user experiences and building scalable applications using a wide range of tools and technologies, including C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Django.

💼 During my internships, I've had the privilege to work on exciting projects that have allowed me to refine my skills. At Business Web Solutions, I dived into creating responsive web pages and integrating APIs to enhance the overall user experience.

🔧 Furthermore, during my time at SatCard, I played a pivotal role in improving the frontend of their admin website, making it more intuitive and visually appealing. I also took charge of integrating the WhatsApp Business API using Python and Django and built a dynamic 'Reports' page that empowers administrators to analyze real-time data collected from field devices, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

💡 Alongside my practical experiences, I'm an enthusiastic participant in competitive programming on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. These coding challenges continuously sharpen my problem-solving skills and keep me at the forefront of the latest algorithms and data structures.

🌐 My quest for growth and innovation drives me to stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and explore new and innovative solutions to complex problems.

🤝 I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on open-source projects, and actively contribute to the vibrant tech community. Let's join forces and create something exceptional together!
